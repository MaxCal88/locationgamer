Title: Identification of Location Game Equilibria in Connected and Disconnected Networks

Description: Identification of equilibrium locations in location games (Hotelling (1929) <doi:10.2307/2224214>). In these games, two competing actors want to 
    place customer-serving units in two locations simultaneously. Customers make the 
    decision to visit the location that is closest to them. 
    The functions in this package include Prim algorithm (Prim (1957) <doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1957.tb01515.x>) to find the minimum spanning tree connecting all network vertices, 
    an implementation of Dijkstra algorithm (Dijkstra (1959) <doi:10.1007/BF01386390>) to find the shortest distance and path between any two vertices, an algorithm using elimination of purely dominated
    strategies to find the Nash equilibrium, and several plotting functions.
