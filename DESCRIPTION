Title: Tools to Find Equilibria in Networks for Location Games
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Maximilian Zellner
Maintainer: Maximilian Zellner <zellnermaximilian@gmail.com>
Description: Identification of Nash equilibrium locations in location games. In these games, two competing actors want to 
    place customer-serving units in two locations simultaneously. Customers make the 
    decision to visit the location that is closest to them. 
    The functions in this package include Prim algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree connecting all network vertices, 
    an implementation of Djikstra algorithm to find the shortest distance and path between any two vertices, an algorithm using elimination of purely dominated
    strategies to find the Nash equilibrium, and several plotting functions.
